% more network characteristics

% matching index = sum distinct common neighbours / sum total number of
    % neighbours
    
% degree centrality = degree of N    
    
% closeness centrality = 1 / sum distance between N and all others
    % or N-1 / same sum (normalised version
    
% betweenness centrality = total number of shortest paths that go through N
    % / total number of shortest paths
    
% eccentricity centrality = 1 / max distance to another node 

% motifs??

% modularity?

% assortativity

% global and local efficiency
